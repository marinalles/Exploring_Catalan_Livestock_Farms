# Exploring Catalan Livestock Farms

This project is to satisfy my personal curiosity about the livestock farms in Catalunya (Spain). 

The dataset that is wrangled and analysed comes from the Dades Obertes de Catalunya, where it is fetched through an API call from https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat/Medi-Rural-Pesca/Registre-d-explotacions-ramaderes/7bpt-5azk. The dataset provides information about around 1000 farms in 49 columns.

The goal is to answer the following questions:

- What are the 5 most and least frequent animals in farms?
- Are there differences on animal species based on the province?
- How many organic farms are and what are the most frequent species?
- Where are the organic farms located?
